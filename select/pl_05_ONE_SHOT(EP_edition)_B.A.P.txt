Here comes the man with the game plan
Many legends Just like the reignman
Black mamba also the mailman
throw the ball in the air comes the jump man
NEW ERA lead the generation
超絶なPlayがMotivation
Who got game? He got game
Play hard never stay the same
All I want is to play
so will you come fly with me
I fell over and over
it's how we learn
above and beyond
*
Give me your best shot
What time is it
Just one shot
Oh it's game time
Give me your best shot
What time is it
Give me your best shot
Oh it's game time
Shoot the ball whether if your short or tall
run for the team and even if you fall,
they got your back they understand you
alley-OOP in your face and he's right behind you
killer cross over and over
with another attack they're coming closer
超絶なplayでgame over
don't sweat the technique
All I want is to play
in the memory of RUN TMC
I fell over and over
that is why we RIZE in the air
*Repeat
you win sometimes you lose sometimes
opportunity comes in a life time
never giving up my game cuz I fight,
all day every day day or night
you win sometimes you lose sometimes
opportunity comes in a life time
the secret of this game,
you'll miss 100% of the shots you don't take
you win sometimes you lose sometimes
opportunity comes in a life time
どう転ぶも立て直すのも
涙や感動に導かれるもの
you win sometimes you lose sometimes
opportunity comes in a life time
Blood Sweat and Respect
first two you give the last you get
*Repeat
